# Palto-Server

(This is a project realised for our University, it will not be maintained after and it should not be used outside of testing)

Palto is a project to check students attendances at their school classes. 
It allows teachers to create sessions containing students that should be present. 
They can then scan their student card with the NFC technology and they will be automatically marked as present to 
this session.
